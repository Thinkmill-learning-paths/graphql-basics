# GraphQL basics

## Step 1 - Backend

In this step we will be setting up our server, creating a graphql endpoint and a graphiql playground for experimenting.

Stuff exists:

- hello world schema
- a database with seed data
- a test setup
- a bare bones express server

### 1. Expose the graphql api via an express app resolver

### 2. Create a resolver to retrieve a task by id

### 3. Create a resolver to retrieve a filtered list of tasks

### 4. Add create/update and delete mutations.
